### Description
<a id="description"></a>
This is a Python-based project that allows you to analyze and extract insights from a dataset containing information
about bike-sharing systems in three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C.
By using Python programming, the program efficiently processes and analyzes the dataset, allowing users to gain 
valuable insights into bike-sharing patterns and trends in the selected cities.

### Prerequisites
<a id="prerequisites"></a>
To get started with the program **bikeshare.py**, you should have **Python** installed on your computer, along with the necessary
libraries.
You can install Python from the official Python website [https://www.python.org/], and the required libraries can be installed using 
pip, the Python package installer.
The main libraries used in the program are **pandas, NumPy, and datetime.** 
In addition to Python and the required libraries, you will also need the dataset containing the bikeshare data for the three cities:
Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. This dataset are provided in the following files:
- **chicago.csv**
- **new_york_city.csv**
- **washington.csv**
Once you have the necessary prerequisites in place, you can start exploring the bikeshare data and running the program to analyze and
extract insights.

### Installation
<a id="Installation"></a>
To install and run the Explore Bikeshare Data project, you'll need to follow these steps:

 1. Clone the project repository:
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
    - Run the following command:
      git clone https://github.com/udacity/pdsnd_github.git

 2. Install the required dependencies:
    - Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website:
       [https://www.python.org/downloads/].
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the project directory:
       cd myprojects
    - Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
       pip install -r requirements.txt

 3. Run the project:
    - In the project directory, you'll find a file named **bikeshare.py**.
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the following command to start the program:
       python bikeshare.py
That's it! You should now be able to explore the bikeshare data by following the prompts in the terminal or command prompt.

Please note that the above steps assume you have Git and Python already installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, 
you'll need to install them before proceeding with the project.

### Usage
<a id="usage"></a>
The original datasets can be found in the files : - **chicago.csv**, **new_york_city.csv** and **washington.csv**
The file : **bikeshare.py** is the performed project.
		
### Results
<a id="results"></a>
In this project, data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States was explored where the following 
tasks were done:

- Developed the Python code to import and clean the bikeshare data, implemented the computation of descriptive statistics using
Pandas and NumPy libraries.
- Successfully analyzed the bikeshare data and generated insightful findings, including key metrics such as average trip duration,
popular stations, and peak usage times.
