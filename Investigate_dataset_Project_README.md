### Description
<a id="description"></a>
This project aims to analyze the factors contributing to patients not showing up for their medical appointments in Brazil. The original
source of data is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments). The project  likely involves examining a 
dataset containing information about various variables such as patient demographics, appointment details, and other relevant factors.
By investigating this issue, insights can be found into the reasons behind no-show appointments and potentially identify patterns or
trends that can help healthcare providers improve their appointment scheduling and reduce the number of missed
appointments.

The project involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques to uncover
meaningful insights. 

Overall, the goal of investigating no-show medical appointments in Brazil is to provide valuable insights that can help healthcare
providers optimize their scheduling processes and improve patient attendance rates.
 
### Prerequisites
<a id="prerequisites"></a>
 - **Python:** Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website:
[https://www.python.org/downloads/]

 - **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook, which is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents
that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. You can install it using the following command:
 **pip install jupyter**

 - **Pandas:** Install the Pandas library, which is a powerful data manipulation tool. You can install it using the following command:
 **pip install pandas**

 - **NumPy:** Install the NumPy library, which is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. You can install it using
the following command:
**pip install numpy**

 - **Matplotlib:** Install the Matplotlib library, which is a plotting library for the Python programming language. You can install it
 using the following command:
**pip install matplotlib**

- **Seaborn:** Install the Seaborn library, which is a data visualization library based on Matplotlib. You can install it using the
following command:
**pip install seaborn**

- Jupyter Notebook Extensions: Install Jupyter Notebook Extensions to enhance your Jupyter Notebook experience. You can install it using
the following command:
**pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions**
  
In addition to Python and the required libraries, you will also need the dataset file whis is in :
 **noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv**
 
### Installation
<a id="Installation"></a>
- Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Imanshr/my_projects.git

Open Jupyter Notebook: Navigate to the project directory and open Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
jupyter notebook

Please note that the above steps assume you have Git and Python already installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, 
you'll need to install them before proceeding with the project.

### Usage
<a id="usage"></a>
The original datasets can be found in the file : **noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv**
The file : **investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb** is the performed project.
		
### Results
<a id="results"></a>
In this project, the dataset being investigated collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil focused on whether or
not patients show up for their appointment was explored where the following tasks were done: 

 - Conducted data wrangling tasks to ensure data quality and consistency.
 - Performed data exploration and analysis using Python programming, utilizing libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to extract insights
 -  and patterns from dataset.
 - Generated visualizations and summaries to effectively communicate the findings of the analysis, including factors influencing patient
 -  attendance for appointment.
